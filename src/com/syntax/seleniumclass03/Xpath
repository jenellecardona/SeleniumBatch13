In HTML DOM:
Purple => Tag
Brown => Attributes


Why do we need Xpath and CSS Selector?
Developers may not provide all the locators in html
by using xpath and css we can identify elements with any given attributes

What is an Xpath?
Xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify

Types of Xpath:
Absolute Xpath => starts from the starting node of the html
                it always starts with a single slash (/)
                i.e /html/body/div/div/div  (facebook)
Relative Xpath => it will start from any node in the html
                   it will always start with double slash
Syntax for relative Xpath -- //tagname[Aattribute = 'attribute value']
                            i.e //input[@id = 'email'] (facebook)
Identifying elements by its text:
//tagname[text() = 'text value']
i.e //a[text() = 'Create new account'] (facebook)
//h2[text() = 'Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook.']

Identifying elements by using contains method:
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]
e.g.
//input[contains(@placeholder,'Email')]
e.g.
//h2[contains(text(), 'the world')]

Starts with will identify elements by its partial starting value
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]
i.e  //input[starts-with(@placeholder, 'Email')]

** ends-with was used in Xpath 1.0, we are using 2.0 and this method is not available

Advanced Xpath:
is based on parent, child and sibling relationships
Identifying element by following sibling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/following-sibling::tagname

Identifying elements by proceeding siblings:
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/proceeding-sibling::tagname

Identifying elements by its parent:
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/parent::tagname
i.e  //span[text() = '& Orders']/parent::a

Identifying elements by its ancestors:
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/ancestor::tagname
i.e  //input[@id = 'email']/ancestor::div

identifying elements by its index:
(//img[@class = 'ui-datepicker-trigger'])[1]
