Selenium Class 5:
Radio Button=> can only select one
Check Boxes=> can select multiple options

Handling check boxes and radio buttons:
if you only have one check box or one radio button. You can just click on it.
if you have multiple choices you can store them in a list and loop through them.

DropDowns
Dropdown is a menu which gives us an opportunity to select one or more options

Types:
1. Single Select
2. Multiple Select

Handling DropDowns:
1. click on dropdowns and click on option
2. use a select class (in order to use select class we need to make sure our dropdown element has a select tag.)


Three different ways to select an option from a dropdown:
1. Index
2. Visible Test
3. Value

Whenever you interact with multiple elements you store them inside the container such as List, Set etc..

In order to deselect the option from the dropdown:
1. Make sure your dropdown is multiple select
deselectByValue()
deselectByIndex()
deselectByVisibleText()
deselectAll()

**If your ODNT have the SELECT tag you will not be able to getOptions()
