ALERTS:
Alerts is a pop up message. Alerts take complete focus off our main page that we are on.
We can not proceed until we it is handled.



windows based alerts
WEB BASED/HTML ALERTS- we can simply inspect those alerts and perform actions needed
JAVASCRIPT/BROWSER ALERT- We can handle
Since this is a part of the browser we will not be able to inspect it
WINDOWS BASED ALERT - we can not handle these alerts through selenium

Anything that is a part of the webpage is inspectable

TYPES OF JAVASCRIPT ALERTS:
1. Simple Alert - click ok
2. Confirmation Alert-either accept or dismiss
3. prompt alert- enter the text and then click ok or cancel

To handle JavaScript Alerts we only have 4 methods:
1. accept()
2. dismiss()
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()

FRAMES:
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
Frames allow devs to represent multiple vies on one page

3 ways to interact or to switch to a frame
1. by index
2. by name or id
3. by webelement

In Alerts => switch to an alert manually and gets switched automatically once you've acknowledged the a;ert
In Frames ==> switch to frame manually and switch back to the main page manually as well.
