CSS Selector (Cascading Styling Sheet)
it is another way of locating elements on the web page.

Syntax:
tagname[attribute = 'attribute value ']

i.e input[value = 'LOGIN']

CSS does not allow us to locate the elements by its text.

Shortcuts for CSS:
**you can only use classname and ID shortcut

shortcut for the class name =>  "."
syntax=>  tagname.classNameValue

shortcut for ID => "#"
Syntax=>  tagname#txtPassword

contains() method in css:

* symbol will represent contains method
tagname[attribute *= 'partial attribute value']
input[placeholder *= 'phone']
starts-with method in css:

starts-with() method in css:

^ (Circumflex) symbol represents starts-with method
tagname[attribute ^= 'starting attribute value']
i.e   input[aria-label ^= 'Pass']

ends-with method in css:
$ (Symbol that represents ends-with method in css)
i.e  a[href $= 'login']

Xpath vs CSS
1. CSS can not locate the elements by text whereas xpath can
2. CSS has shortcuts
3. Xpath does not have ends-with method
4. CSS is faster than Xpath in locating elements


WebElements Commands:
consists of several methods where we can perform an action and get the element state on the webpage

isEnabled() ==> boolean
isDisplayed() ==> boolean
isSelected() ==> boolean
clear() ==> void
getText() ==> String
getAttribute() ==> String
submit() ==> void

Something to keep in mind when we use method overriding is that
If the method cannot be inherited or is declared final then it cannot be overridden.
